<h1>J2ME Reversi</h1>

<p>This is a simple board game. It is also known as othello. If you don't
know the rules, just browse the web, you can find hundrends of reversi
games. </p>

<p>This version of the game runs on devices compliant with the Mobile
Information Device Profile (MIDP), for instance cellular phones.</p>

<p>Note: Since I don't have a MIDP device, it's tested only with an
emulator. </p>

<p>The first public version will be available in a few days.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

I wanted to learn J2ME, so I implemented this small game. First time
(years ago) I've implemented reversi using Turbo Pascal, later I
converted it to C (it was an artificial intelligence project for my
University). Now I converted it to Java (J2ME).

The artificial intelligence is quite dumb in this version. It was much
better in the C version, maybe I'll enhance it later.

<h2>How to compile?</h2>

The game is precompiled, so if you want only to play with the game,
you don't need to compile it. 

If you really want to compile, you'll need the followings:

<ul>
<li>Java 2 JDK (tested with IBM's Java 2 JDK 1.3 for Linux)</li>
<li>J2ME wireless toolkit (tested with version 1.0.4)</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Go to the bin directory</li>
<li>Change the path of JAVA_HOME and WTK_HOME.</li>
<li>./build.sh</li>
<li>Change the jar file size in the jad file (j2me_reversi.jad) [This
is not necessary for me, but the program may not work without this]</li>
</ol>

<h2>How to run?</h2>

<ol>
<li>Go to the bin directory</li>
<li>Change the path of WTK_HOME.</li>
<li>./run.sh</li>
</ol>

Since I have no MIDP device, I don't know how to use the program on
such a device. If you have one, please test it, and inform me.
