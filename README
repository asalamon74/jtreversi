jtReversi (a.k.a. J2ME_Reversi)

What is it?
-----------

This is a simple board game. It is also known as othello. If you don't
know the rules, just browse the web, you can find hundreds of reversi
games. Later I'll include here a small description.

This version of the game runs on devices compliant with the Mobile
Information Device Profile (MIDP), for instance cellular phones.

Note: The program has been tested only a limited number of real MIDP devices.

Why?
----

I wanted to learn J2ME, so I implemented this small game. First time
(years ago) I've implemented reversi using Turbo Pascal, later I
converted it to C (it was an artificial intelligence project for my
University). Now I converted it to Java (J2ME).

How to compile?
---------------

The game is precompiled, so if you want only to play with the game,
you don't need to compile it. 

If you really want to compile, you'll need the followings:

-Java 2 JDK (tested with IBM's Java 2 JDK 1.3 for Linux)
-J2ME wireless toolkit (tested with version 1.0.4)
-Jakarta-Ant (at least version 1.5)
-antenna (version 0.9.5 or newer)

0. set JAVA_HOME environment variable
1. Change the path of wtk.home in .ant.properties file.
2. ant

How to compile with obfuscator?
-------------------------------

If you use obfuscator, the size of the jar file will be smaller. Currently
the build process (antenna) can use two obfuscators: ProGuard (tested with 
versions 1.4, 1.5) and RetroGuard-1.1.

0. set JAVA_HOME environment variable
1. Copy (or symlink) proguard.jar or retroguard.jar into WTK's bin directory.
2. Change the obfuscate="false" to obfucate="true" in build.xml
3. ant

NOTE: RetroGuard-1.1 is not working for me with J2SDK 1.4.1 for Linux
NOTE2: ProGuard creates smaller jar file for this project.

How to run?
-----------

If you want to try the program, you'll need:

J2ME wireless toolkit (tested with version 1.0.4)

1. Go to the bin directory
2. Change the path of WTK_HOME.
3. ./run.sh (Windows users have to use run.bat instead of run.sh)

How to run with Ant?
--------------------

If you have ant installed you can run the program using ant, instead of
the run.sh (run.bat) scripts.

0. set JAVA_HOME environment variable
1. Change the path of wtk.home in .ant.properties file.
2. ant run 

With Ant you are also able to test the program with microemulator 
(http://microemulator.sourceforge.net): 

0. set JAVA_HOME environment variable
1. Change the path of MICROEMULATOR_HOME in .ant.properties file.
2. ant microrun

Note: Please use at least version 0.3.1 of microemulator.
