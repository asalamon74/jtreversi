J2ME_Reversi

What is it?
-----------

This is a simple board game. It is also known as othello. If you don't
know the rules, just browse the web, you can find hundreds of reversi
games. 

This version of the game runs on devices compliant with the Mobile
Information Device Profile (MIDP), for instance cellular phones.

Note: Since I don't have a MIDP device, it's tested only with an
emulator. 

Why?
----

I wanted to learn J2ME, so I implemented this small game. First time
(years ago) I've implemented reversi using Turbo Pascal, later I
converted it to C (it was an artificial intelligence project for my
University). Now I converted it to Java (J2ME).

How to compile?
---------------

The game is precompiled, so if you want only to play with the game,
you don't need to compile it. 

If you really want to compile, you'll need the followings:

-Java 2 JDK (tested with IBM's Java 2 JDK 1.3 for Linux)
-J2ME wireless toolkit (tested with version 1.0.4)
-Jakarta-Ant (tested with version 1.4.1)

0. set JAVA_HOME environment variable
1. Change the path of WTK_HOME in .ant.properties file.
2. ant

How to compile with obfuscator?
-------------------------------

If you use obfuscator, the size of the jar file will be smaller. Currently
the build process can use two obfuscators: ProGuard-1.4 and RetroGuard-1.1

0. set JAVA_HOME environment variable
1. Change the path of RETROGUARD_HOME or PROGUARD_JAR in .ant.properties file. 
2. Change the obfuscate_null to obfucate_proguard or obfuscate_retroguard in line 
   <target name="unjar" depends="obfuscate_null"> in build.xml
3. ant

NOTE: RetroGuard-1.1 is not working for me with J2SDK 1.4.1 for Linux
NOTE2: ProGuard creates smaller jar file for this project.

How to run?
-----------

If you want to try the program, you'll need:

J2ME wireless toolkit (tested with version 1.0.4)

1. Go to the bin directory
2. Change the path of WTK_HOME.
3. ./run.sh (Windows users have to use run.bat instead of run.sh)

How to run with Ant?
--------------------

If you have ant installed you can run the program using ant, instead of
the run.sh (run.bat) scripts.

0. set JAVA_HOME environment variable
1. Change the path of WTK_HOME in .ant.properties file.
2. ant run

With Ant you are also able to test the program with microemulator 
(http://microemulator.sourceforge.net): 

0. set JAVA_HOME environment variable
1. Change the path of MICROEMULATOR_HOME in .ant.properties file.
2. ant microrun

Note: There is a color bug in microemulator 0.3.0, please use newer 
(e.g. CVS) version.

Since I have no MIDP/CLDC device, I don't know how to use the program on
such a device. If you have one, please test it, and inform me.
